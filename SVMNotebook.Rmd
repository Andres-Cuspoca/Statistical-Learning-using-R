This article will explain how to implement Support Vector Machines in R and their in depth interpretation.

SVM does not uses any Probability Model as such like other Classifiers use , because it directly looks for a Hyperplane which divides and sagments the data and classes.

General form of a Hyperplane is :

$$\beta_0  + \beta_1X_1  +  \beta_2X_2  + . . .. . \beta_pX_p = 0 $$
where $p$ is the number of Dimentions.

1) For $p=2$ i.e 2-D space it is a Line.

2)The vector $(\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3...\beta_p) is \ just \ a \ Normal\ vector.$ A vector in simple terms is just a 1-Dimentional Tensor or a 1-D array.



__Support Vector Classifiers__ are majorly used solving a binary clssification 
problem where we only have 2 class labels say $Y = [-1,1]$ and a bunch of predictors $X_i$ .And what SVM does is that it generates Hyperplanes which in simple terms are just __straight lines or planes__ or are Non-linear curves , and these lines are used to saperate the data or sagment the data into 2 categories or more depending on the type of Classification problem.

We try to find a __plane__ which saperates the classes in some feature space.


This concept of separating data linearly into 2 different classes using a Linear Separator or a straight linear line is called *__Linear Separability__*.
