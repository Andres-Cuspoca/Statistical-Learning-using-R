###Radial Kernel Support Vector Machine

This article will be all about how to separate non linear data using a *__non-linear decision boundary__ *, which cannot be simply separated by a linear separator.

It is often encountered that Linear Separators and boundaries fail because of the non linear interactions in the data and in the non linear dependence between the features in feature space.

So how we solve this problem is via doing a non linear transformation on the features($X_i$) and converting them to a higher dimentional space called a feature space.Now by this transformation we are able to saperate non linear data using a non linear decision boundary.
