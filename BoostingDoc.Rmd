## Boosting

Random Forests actually used to reduce the variance of the Trees by averaging them. SO it generates big Bushy trees and then averages them to get rid of variance.

__Boosting__ on other hand generates smaller simpler trees and goes at the *__Bias__*.So the Idea in Boosting is to convert a *__Weak learner__* to a *__Strong Learner__* by doing *weighted averaging* of lots of Models generated on Harder Examples and using the Information from a previous Model.  

Harder Examples in the sense means the training Examples which were not classified correctly or more generally which were not predicted correctly by the Model.
