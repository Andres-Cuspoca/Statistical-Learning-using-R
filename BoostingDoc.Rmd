## Boosting

Random Forests actually used to reduce the variance of the Trees by averaging them. SO it generates big Bushy trees and then averages them to get rid of variance.

__Boosting__ on other hand generates smaller simpler trees and goes at the *__Bias__*.So the Idea in Boosting is to convert a Weak learner to a Strong Learner by doing *weighted averaging* of lots of Models generated on Harder Examples and using the Information from a previous Model.
