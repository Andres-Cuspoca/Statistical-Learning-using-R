# Statistical-Learning-Techniques

This is a Statistical Learning repository which will consist of various Learning algorithms and their implementation in R 
and their in depth interpretation. Below are the links to the implementation and their in-depth explanation of the learning algorithms in R. All the documents below contain the under-lying mathematical concepts explained with respect to a simple case study in R.


### Topics Covered :

1) Supervised Learning

2) Model Selection techniques

3) Shirinkage Methods and Regularization techniques 

4) Non-linear Regression and parametric models

5) Non-parametric model - K-nearest neighbor algorithm

5) Tree based Modelling

6) Bayesian Modelling technique : Naive Bayes algorithm.

7) Ensemble learning

8) Unsupervised learning

9) 


### First Document published on Polynomial Regression Tecnhiques which adds Non linearities to the Model and makes the model learn Non linear Functions.
