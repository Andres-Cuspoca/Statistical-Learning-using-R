# Statistical-Learning-Techniques

This is a Statistical Learning Application which will consist of various Learning algorithms and their implementation in R 
and their in depth interpretation.


### First Document published on Polynomial Regression Tecnhiques which adds Non linearities to the Model and makes the model learn Non linear Functions.

### Second Document on step by step Implementation of Cubic Splines and Smoothing Splines in R and how they transform the variables by adding Truncated Basis functions b(X) and how it is better from Polynomial Regression, to learn Non linear Functional Mappings from X(Predictors) to Y(Target)
