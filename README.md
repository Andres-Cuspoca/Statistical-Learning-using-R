# Statistical-Learning-Techniques

This is a Statistical Learning Application which will consist of various Learning algorithms and their implementation in R 
and their in depth interpretation.


### First Document published on Polynomial Regression Tecnhiques which adds Non linearities to the Model and makes the model learn Non linear Functions.

### Second Document on Implementing Cubic Splines and Smoothing Splines how it is better from Polynomial Regression, to learn Non linear Functional Mappings from X(Predictors) to Y(Target)
