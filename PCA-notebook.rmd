##Unsupervised Learning

__Unsupervised__ learning is a machine learning technique in which the dataset has no target variable or no response value-$Y$.The data is unlabelled.
Simply saying,there is no target value to supervise the learning process of a learner unlike in __Supervised__ learning where we had training examples which had both input variables $X_i$ and target variable-$Y$ -{$(x_i,y_i)$} and by looking and learning from the training examples the learner used to generate a *mapping* function(also called a __hypothesis__) $f : x_i-> y$ which mapped $x_i$ values to $y$ and learned the relationship between input variables and target variable so that we could generalize it to some random unseen test examples and predict the target value.

The best example of unsupervised learning is when a small child given some unlabelled pictures of cats and dogs , so by only looking at the structural similarities and disimilarities between the images , he classifies one as a dog and other as cat.

There are lots of examples of unsupervised learning around us.

__Unsupervised learning is mostly used as a preprocessing process for supervised learning__.e.g-like PCA could be used to select a linear combination of predictors-$X_i$ which explains the most variability in the data , and reduce a high-dimentional dataset to a lower dimentional view with only most relevant and important features which can be used as inputs in a supervised learning model.

e.g If we have a dataset with 100 predictors and we wanted to generate a model,it would be highly inefficient to use all those 100 predictors because that would increase the variance and complexity of the model and which in turn would lead to __overfitting__.Instead what PCA does is find 10 most correlated variables and linearly combine them to generate a principal component -$Z_1$.
