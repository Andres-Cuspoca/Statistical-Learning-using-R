#MODELLING NON LINEARITIES in DATA using various Non linear functions
#The most basic idead behind adding Non linear properties in the Model is by transforming the 
#data or the variables , alomst every trick transforms the variables to Model Non linearitites
#Say Kernel Smoothing techniques  , Splines or Step functions etc
