#### Loading the required Packages

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
require(ISLR) #package containing data
require(ggplot2)
require(tree)

#Using the Carseats data set 

attach(Carseats)
?Carseats


```


Carseats is a simulated data set containing sales of child car seats at 400 different stores.


```{r}
#Checking the distribution of Sales

ggplot(aes(x = Sales),data = Carseats) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black",fill = 'purple',alpha = 0.6, bins=30) + 
  labs(x = "Unit Sales in Thousands", y = "Frequency")


```
As the histogram suggests - It is Normally distributed
Highest frequency of around 8000 Unit Sales
