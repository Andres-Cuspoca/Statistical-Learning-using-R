## Random Forests 

Random Forests are a __Ensembling__ technique which is similar to a famous Ensemble technique called  *__Bagging__* but a different tweak in it. In Random Forests the idea is to __decorrelates__ the several trees which are generated on the different bootstrapped samples from training Data.And then we simply reduce the Variance of the Trees by averaging them. 

Averaging the Trees helps us to reduce the variance and also improve the Perfomance of Decision Trees on Test Set and eventually avoid Overfitting.

The idea is to build a lots of Trees in such a way to make the *Correlation* between the Trees smaller.
