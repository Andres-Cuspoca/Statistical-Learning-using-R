# Generalized Additive Models


This is also a famous and very flexible technique of fitting and Modelling Non Linear Functions which are more flexible and fits data well.
In this technique we simply add __Non linear Functions__ on different variable to the Regression equation.

$$f(x) = y_i = \alpha \ +  \ f_1(x_1) \ + f_2(x_2) + \ .... + \ f_p(x_p)  $$

$$\text{where} \ f_p(x_p) \ \text {is a Non Linear function on} \  x_p \ variables.$$
